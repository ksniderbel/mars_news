# mars_news

This homework was completed as part of a team effort between Carmen Wiggens, Haritha Koleti, Michelle Petras, and Kathleen Sndier-Belinski (me), with some assistance from TA Sheri Rosalia.  Google was also our friend.

For this project, we will analyze data regarding Mars Weather.  Data was scraped from a website called 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html'.  We were able to gather the data we were looking for.  Once the data was gathered, our analysis of the weather resulted in several charts.

Two resulting files were created:
part_1_mars_news.ipynb that put the data in the database.
part_2_mars_news.ipynb analyzed data.
